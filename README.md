🚨 Incident Response Simulator

A web-based cybersecurity training tool that simulates multiple types of cyber-attacks and helps users learn how to detect and respond to them using realistic logs and step-by-step incident response actions.

This project is part of Security Audit & Compliance and is fully deployable on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

Data Breach

Ransomware Attack (New)

Multiple random logs per scenario

Interactive, step-by-step incident response flow

Clean and modern UI

No backend required

Runs fully in the browser using HTML + CSS + JavaScript + JSON
